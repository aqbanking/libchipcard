This folder contains some tutorial files.

1. tutorial1
============
This is a short introduction into the usage of Libchipcard2.
It simply waits for a card and dumps some information about it.

There are three versions of this tutorial with different levels of verbosity
and error checking. You should study them one by one to understand how
Libchipcard2 can be used.


1.1. tutorial1a
---------------
This version has no documentation and does no error checking, just to let you
have a look at the structure of a Libchipcard2 aware program.


1.2. tutorial1b
---------------
This is a line-by-line documented version of tutorial1a.
It is intended to make you understand what each line does.
Still no error checking


1.3. tutorial1c
---------------
This is a version with complete error checking.



2. tutorial2
============
While tutorial1 only works with base classes we are now to understand how
more complex card classes can be used.
This tutorial waits for a German medical card to be inserted, reads the
information stored on the card and prints it to the standard output channel.




3. tutorial3
============
This tutorial demonstrates how to define your own card type. It therefore
explains the heritage functions of the library Gwenhywfar.
The implementation of the new card type "ExampleCard" can be found in the 
files examplecard.{c,h,xml}.
