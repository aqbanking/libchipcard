<!-- 
  This file only contains an description for an ExampleCard.
  Such a file is not needed for every card application type, but it makes
  it easier to implement and debug a new card application type.
  Such a file contains a description of the file hierarchy on card 
  applications (i.e. what files are stored on the card, the kind of content
  etc).
  For more complex examples see the XML files in data/apps/.

        This element now contains the file hierarchy.
        A chipcard most likely has a master file (the same as the root of a
        disc-based filesystem), which contains multiple DF (equivalent to
        directories in filesystems) and EF (equivalent to files in 
        filesystems). Each DF/EF has an identifier (at least a short one, some
        also have aliases).
