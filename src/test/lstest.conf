#



# ===========================================================================
# Autoconfiguration
#

#
# if "1" then autoconfiguration (via USB scanning) is disabled
# For autoconfiguration to work libchipcard2-server must be linked against
# libUSB. This is automatically done if libusb is available at compile time.
#
int disableAutoConf="0"

#
# minimum time in seconds which has to elapse between two USB scans
# USB scans only check for readers which do NOT use ttyUSBx devices (like
# the SCM Chipdrive Pinpad or newer Cyberjacks)
# A value of "0" makes the chipcard daemon only scan once (thus allowing
# only initial setup of already connected readers)
#
int usbScanInterval="2"

#
# minimum time in seconds which has to elapse between two USB-Serial scans
# USB-Serial scans check for readers which use ttyUSBx devices (like the old
# Cyberjack).
# A value of "0" makes the chipcard daemon only scan once (thus allowing
# only initial setup of already connected readers)
#
int usbTtyScanInterval="2"


# ===========================================================================
# Remote Drivers
#
# Remote drivers are used with thin clients: In such a configuration there
# is a central chipcard daemon to which the card readers of all thin clients
# connect. This is going to be used by Gnumed.
#

# if 0 then remote drivers are not allowed to connect to the server 
# default: "0"

  # Drivers
  #
  # A driver section contains information about a driver and the readers
  # supported by this driver.
  #
  # Please note that you only need driver sections for serial readers (i.e.
  # readers which are connected to COM1-COMx). USB readers are autodetected.
  #
  # If you have an USB reader which is not recognized by Libchipcard you 
  # really should drop an email to martin@libchipcard.de containing the output
  # of the command "lsusb" and the following extra information:
  # - path and name of the driver
  # - location from where you downloaded the driver
  # - name of the card reader
  # That would allow me to add the driver to the list and hence to support
  # this card reader.
  #
  # However, if autoconfiguration is disabled (either by config file, see 
  # above or because libUSB is not available) you need a driver section and 
  # reader sections therein for every reader you want to use.
  #
  # To activate one of the examples below remove the ".inactive" suffix
  # (driver.inactive -> driver)
