Running in Daemon Mode
======================

You can run the tool "kvkread" in daemon mode by using the following
command:
"kvkread daemon"

This command allows to set the name and arguments of a program to be called
when there is a card inserted (arguments "-p" and "-a").

There is a specialty with the "-a" argument: All occurrences of 
"@cardid@" are replaced by the card id of the actual card in hexadecimal
form (e.g. "0x12345678").

If the argument "-p" is missing then the following will be used:
  - for "-p": "kvkread"
  - for "-a": "read -b -d -c @cardid@ -f kvkcard-@cardid@.dat"
This makes the tool write the data of every German medical card to a file
in the current folder with the card id as part of the filename.

If an error occurs the tool will beep 3 times, on success it will beep
only once (that's a result of the switch "-b" used by default).

If the switch "-d" was given to kvkread in daemon mode it will propagate
this switch to the called "kvkread" thus making it write DOS files.
