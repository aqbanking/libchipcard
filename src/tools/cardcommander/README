This folder contains a very basic program that allows you to send raw
APDUs to a chip card.

It is only usefull for people trying to implement new card classes, like
me ;-)

It prooved at least to me to be very usefull even because of its simplicity.

After starting the tool try "help". That will you show all commands
available (which a very few for now ;-)
