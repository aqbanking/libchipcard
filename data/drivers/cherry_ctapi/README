This driver adds support for Cherry keyboards to Libchipcard2.

For this to work you need to do the following:
- apply the kernel-patch which comes with the package cherry-ctapi
- compile and install the kernel (tested with 2.4.31)
- compile and install the package cherry-ctapi

The kernel patch only provides support for Cherry 1501 keybards, and it
only reads German medical cards.
