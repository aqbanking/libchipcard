Howto install the proprietary driver from http://www.omnikey.at
===============================================================

1) download the driver
2) unpack the downloaded file
3) enter folder created by previous step
4) "./install --nopcscd"

This should create all necessary files and install the driver to appropriate
locations where Libchipcard2 should find them.

If you already have a kernel module then you might want to just copy the
file libcm4000.so from the package to "/usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/".
