===============

This folder contains driver definitions.
Each subfolder contains at least a file called "driver.xml" which lists all
readers support by a given driver and contains some other usefull information
about it. There might also be more XML files which contain the driver-specific
versions of commands for some cards. Basically abstraction of the driver and
reader is done by those files.
