1. Introduction
===============

This folder contains driver definitions.
Each subfolder contains at least a file called "driver.xml" which lists all
readers support by a given driver and contains some other usefull information
about it. There might also be more XML files which contain the driver-specific
versions of commands for some cards. Basically abstraction of the driver and
reader is done by those files.



2. Description of "driver.xml"
==============================

The element "driver" may contain a subelement "vars" which influence
Libchipcard2s' behaviour regarding the particular driver.
The following variables are supported:

autoPortOffset
--------------
This variable is used when a driver needs an automatically assigned port (like
the latest Cyberjack). For some drivers "0" must be used (which is the 
default) but for the latest Cyberjack "1" is necessary.

autoPortMode
------------
This variable describes how devices are to be counted when automatically
assigning a port value. The following modes are supported:
 - productid: VendorId *and* ProductId must match to count a device
 - vendorId:  VendorId suffices
