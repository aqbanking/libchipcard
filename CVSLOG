- some fixes
- services are now based on clients (since services basically *are* clients
  which serve other clients)
- removed "OfferService" command
- added reader flags: NOINFO, REMOTE and AUTO
- reconnecting to a server now works
- unplugged readers are now removed (if they have been autocreated)
