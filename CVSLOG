- started working on first service: cardfs.
  This service will be part of a small service group which allows to view
  cards as a file system with special folders for any supported kind of
  cards.
- added monitoring for services
- added open- and close- and command service functions to client library
- chipcard-tool: now shows services, too. Also, you can now tell this tool
  *what* you are interested in:
  --services: if present services are listed
  --drivers:  if present drivers are listed
  --readers:  if present readers are listed
  It neither of these options are given the previous behaviour is selected
  where drivers and readers are listed.
- reordered functions in client.h
