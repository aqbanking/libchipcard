- fixed some bugs
- added service: "KVKs". This is the replacement for libchipcard1s' "kvkd".
  It is now implemented as a service to Libchipcard2. It monitors all
  inserted cards, and if a memory card is found it tries to read that card.
  If the card is a KVK card its data is written to a file (same format as
  for kvkd).
  To start this service you have to add a "service" section to your
  chipcardd2.conf file:
  
  service {
    char serviceName="kvks"
    char serviceDataDir="YOUR_DATA_FOLDER"
    char logFile="YOUR_LOGFILE" # or omit this for reasonable defaults
    char flags="autoload" # this make the server load this service upon
                          # its own start
  } # service
