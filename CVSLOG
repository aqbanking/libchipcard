- moved usb stuff to a convenience library of its own, to be used by drivers
  and setup tools in addition to the server
- no longer install the driver library (it is not needed by any tool except
  the built-in drivers, and no program should need it)
- added library libchipcard2i.so (provides information about installed drivers
  and USB devices, this might be used by setup tools)
- added build-rules for WIN32 platforms (now compiles and the client already
  works)
