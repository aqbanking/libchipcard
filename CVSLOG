- added license exception needed for Debian
- no longer install the server library (it is not needed by any tool except
  the chipcard daemon, and no program should need it)
- no longer install ctapi.h (not needed and it interferes with the same file
  from some drivers)
- added prefix "CHIPCARD_API" to all exported functions
