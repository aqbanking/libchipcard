- HandleDriverReady() now reads driverFlagsValue and driverFlagsMask from
  request, thus modifying the driverFlags according to the drivers info
- moved definition of LCDM_DRIVER_FLAGS to sharedstuff
- added two arguments to LC_Driver_Connect which allow modifying the driver
  flags (needed to flag support for driver-specific pin modifications/
  verification)
- added handler and virtual functions for pin verification and modification
  to driver base module
- temporarily disabled "keypad" flags for "Kobil Advanced" (I'm working on
  that)
