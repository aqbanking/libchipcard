- more work on file system (added new file system which works with real
  files in a folder).
  When this is finished I will have to write a service which will for example
  offer a filesystem hierarchy which shows information about readers, cards,
  clients, service etc). Later I can built a KIO module for that...
- fixed a bug in the driver description file for Cyberjack ("autoPortMode"
  must be set to "vendorId")
