- pin verification via the keypad of the Kobil Kaan Advanced now works!!
- reordered calls for NewCard callback in server-code: Now the CommandManager
  is called before the ClientManager, because the CommandManager determines
  the types of the card according to its ATR
- removed driver-specific parts from card description files (I will have
  to clean those up)
