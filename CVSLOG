- added command "CardCheck" which checks whether a card has been removed
- added command "CardReset" 
- added an ATR database: When a card is inserted the server checks the list of
  known cards for ATRs. If any of them matches the corresponding card type is 
  added to the list of possible card types. "chipcard-tool atr" should now show
  this.
  However, this only lists the *possible* card types, e.g. there is no way to
  tell an EC (Euro Cheque) card from a DDV card by ATR.
- started working on a fake CTAPI
