- introduced lockmanager. This is now used to lock reader slots for used 
  cards. This is to prepare to allow the direct use of readers by client
  applications as needed e.g. to access the fingerprint scanner of the 
  Cyberjack Biometric reader.
- when a card reader is locked by a client card status checks are temporarily
  suspended. After the reader is unlocked (either explicitly or implicitly
  upon shutdown of the client) card status checks are resumed.
- reader notifications now again contain the readerInfo field
- implemented client-functions to lock and unlock a card reader
