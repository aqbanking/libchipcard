- improved handling of drivers which do not behave themselves:
  E.g. sometimes the Cyberjack driver simply hangs upon CT_close(). This is 
  now detected and the driver is in this case terminated with brute force
  (signal KILL)
- fixed some bugs which made the server hold readers forever if a special
  command error occurred
- now transitional states are detected: I.e. if a client wants to access a 
  reader which is on its way down (or if its driver is going down) then the
  server finishes the deinitialisation in progress and remembers to start the
  reader afterwards
- fixed some possible problems in driver process (e.g. detect whether GWEN's
  IPC code is running wild)
- example server configuration files are now copied to the system folder
- the server now shows a message about whether USB support is enabled
- reworked Cyberjack-stuff:
  Added a driver configuration for the new Cyberjack driver (2.x) while the
  existing Cyberjack driver configuration uses the old driver (1.x) only.
  Now old AND new Cyberjack devices work in parallel.
- added code which autodetects the port value to be used for new Cyberjack
  drivers.
