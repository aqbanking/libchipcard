- switched from SCM driver to open source CCID driver for SCM readers.
  This has been tested with an SPR532 reader.
  For Libchipcard2 to be able to use this driver you'll have to compile the
  driver yourself:
    ./configure --disable-pcsclite
    make
    make install
- added support for old AND new IFD interface. This allows supporting old
  and new IFD drivers. Libchipcard2 now supports both CCID and SCM drivers
  for SCM SPR532. Whichever driver exists will be used.
- added missing files
