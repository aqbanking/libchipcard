- added crypttoken for STARCOS cards ("Matrica")
- added function pointers to LC_CARD for generic ISO commands
- added crypttoken definitions to ddv0.xml and starcos.xml
- modified card module LC_STARCOS (breaks compatibility with AqHBCIs
  RSACard plugin. However, AqHBCI now uses crypttokens so that plugin
  is obsolete anyway)
