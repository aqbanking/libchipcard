- prepared server/driver code to let a driver send a list of supported 
  readers. This is needed for remote drivers and later for a PC/SC driver.
- decreased verbosity of chipcard-tool
- fixed some minor bugs
- prepared remote drivers: Remote drivers are used with networks of thin 
  clients (as requested by Gnumed developers). 
  With such a configuration there is a central chipcard daemon to which card
  readers connected to thin clients can connect. At this central server there
  may be a service which uses all readers at all thin clients (as the KVK
  service does). This feature has been requested and sponsored by Gnumed.
  
  I'm still working on the process watcher which will start and monitor the 
  remote drivers at the thin clients. This watcher has to restart the driver
  when the connection between driver and server has been cut off.
