- added driver variable "autoportmode" which defines how ports are to be
  assigned automatically:
  - productid: VendorId *and* ProductId must match to count a device
  - vendorId:  VendorId suffices
  Now the cyberjack uses the mode "vendorid" because to find out the port to
  be used we must also count old Cyberjacks (thats why the driver does this,
  too). Should now improve support for new Cyberjack.
