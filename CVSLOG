- complete redesing of the server core.
  Divided core into multiple submodules which are quite independant from each
  other. This makes it easier to debug the code if necessary.
  New subgroups:
   - CardManager
   - ClientManager
   - DeviceManager
   - ServiceManager
  This transition is not yet complete. The new core also handles folders much
  better (i.e. no hardcoded folders).
- format of server configuration file changed slightly (should still read most
  existing config files, though)
