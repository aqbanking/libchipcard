Cyberjack Devices
-----------------
Q: How can I identify which cyberjack I have ?
A: Just execute the command "lsusb". One of the lines should say something
   like this:
       Bus xxx Device yyy: ID 0c4b:0100 (for old Cyberjacks or ecom)
   or
       Bus xxx Device yyy: ID 0c4b:0300 (for new Cyberjacks)
   New Cyberjacks need version 2.x of the driver, versions 1.x don't work
   here. Old devices work best with the old driver (1.x).

Q: Neither Libchipcard nor cjgeldkarte can access my Cyberjack, even though
   Libchipcard2 detects the reader. What can I do ?
A: If the tool cjgeldkarte (which comes with the driver) shows an error on
   CT_init with the code "-127" then you should try to use another USB port.
   Just plug the reader into another USB port. For me that fixed this problem.

Q: What driver should I use for my device ?
A: If you have an old device (old Cyberjack or ecom) then you should most
   definately use the old driver, 1.x. The new driver sometimes gets confused
   if there are other devices present which also use the USB serial converter
   interface (e.g. Palm, modems etc).
   For newer devices you MUST use the new driver (2.x), since the old one
   doesn't support those devices.
   
   If you have both - an old and a new Cyberjack device - you should rename
   one of the drivers, e.g. driver 1.x:
     libctapi_cyberjack.so -> libctapi_cyberjack1.so
   You should also move these drivers to Libchipcard2's own lowlevel driver
   folder, $PREFIX/lib/chipcard2-server/lowlevel. This makes sure that
   Libchipcard2 always uses the correct driver.
   However, since version 2.0.6 the driver contains a nice workaround which is
   used by Libchipcard2, so you may use this version with both old and new
   Cyberjacks.
