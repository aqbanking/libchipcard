Cyberjack Devices
-----------------
Q: How can I identify which cyberjack I have ?
A: Just execute the command "lsusb". One of the lines should say something
   like this:
       Bus xxx Device yyy: ID 0c4b:0100 (for old Cyberjacks or ecom)
   or
       Bus xxx Device yyy: ID 0c4b:0300 (for new Cyberjacks)
   New Cyberjacks need version 2.x of the driver, versions 1.x don't work
   here. Old devices work best with the old driver (1.x).

Q: Neither Libchipcard nor cjgeldkarte can access my Cyberjack, even though
   Libchipcard2 detects the reader. What can I do ?
A: If the tool cjgeldkarte (which comes with the driver) shows an error on
   CT_init with the code "-127" then you should try to use another USB port.
   Just plug the reader into another USB port. For me that fixed this problem.

Q: What driver should I use for my device ?
A: You should use driver 2.0.9 or later.
