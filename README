1. Introduction
===============

Libchipcard2 is a library for generic access to chipcard readers. It contains
a complete ressource manager and uses the hardware drivers provided by
manufacturers of card readers. The number of readers to be used in parallel
is unbound.

Libchipcard2 has some advantages over existing card reader ressource managers:
 - autodetection of readers at multiple buses
 - readers are only allocated upon request by a client (while no client needs
   access to a given reader this reader is not accessed by Libchipcard2)
 - it provides a fake CTAPI which can be used by any CTAPI-aware program
   to use Libchipcard2 via CTAPI

Libchipcard2 autodetects and automatically configures readers at the following
buses:
 - raw USB
 - USB serial
 - PCI
 - PCMCIA




2. Needed Components
====================

Libchipcard2 needs the following packages:
- Gwenhywfar http://gwenhywfar.sf.net/          [required]
- LibUSB     http://libusb.sf.net/              [strongly recommended]
- LibSysFS   http://linux-diag.sf.net/          [recommended]
- OpenSC     http://www.opensc.org/             [optional]
- Kernel sources (needed for PCMCIA)            [optional]

If LibUSB is available at compile time it will be used to scan the USB bus
for new devices. Fortunately LibUSB is ported to the major *nix-alike 
systems ;-)
If LibUSB is missing autoconfiguration of USB devices is not possible.

For devices which use a /dev/ttyUSBx device the procfs file 
"/proc/tty/driver/usb-serial" or "/proc/tty/driver/usbserial" is used.
However, revent kernels (2.6.x) only allow root to view these files, so
for these systems LibSysFS (part of sysfsutils) is needed.

If OpenSC is installed then the OpenSC-driver for Libchipcard2 is built and
installed. This driver allows OpenSC to use Libchipcard.

If the kernel sources are installed at compile time then the PCMCIA scanner
code is built. This allows to detect PCMCIA-based card readers.



3. Server Setup
===============

The chipcard daemon uses the configuration file 
    $PREFIX/etc/chipcard2-server/chipcardd2.conf

This file contains a description of which drivers to load and a list of
configured readers.

You can copy one of the example files installed to 
"$PREFIX/etc/chipcard2-server/". For USB-only readers the minimal example
can be used. For serial devices the file "chipcardd2.conf.example" can be used
as a starting point.


3.1. Security Mode
------------------

The underlying IPC (interprocess communication) model used allows a variety
of security modes:
 
 a) local
    This mode uses Unix Domain Sockets. These sockets are only available on
    POSIX systems (not on WIN32 platforms), they can only be connected to from
    the very same machine.
    This is the recommended mode for local-only usage.
    
 b) public
    This mode uses simple TCP sockets for IPC. You should not use this mode
    since it does not provide any encryption.
 
 c) private
    This mode uses SSL secured sockets. This is the recommended mode on
    systems where there are no Unix Domain Sockets (i.e. the "local" mode is
    not available).
    
 d) secure
    This mode is the same as "private", but it requires the client to present
    a valid certificate. This certificate is looked up in a directory on the
    server and if not found access will be denied.
    You can use this mode if you want to be very safe. It also allows the
    server to distinguish between multiple users accessing the server, so that
    administration accounts can be realized (which will only allow special
    users to execute administrative commands).

For security modes "private" and "secure" some additional setup is to be done.
You can do most of that additional setup with the following command:

#>chipcardd2 init

This will create all files necessary for "private" or "secure" mode (such as
Diffie-Hellman-parameters, a self-signed certificate etc).

You have to create the server configuration file first (e.g. by just copying
one of the example files provided by this package).

Please refer to the file doc/CERTIFICATES for details.


3.2. Adding Readers
-------------------

#>chipcardd2 addreader --rname ARG --dtype ARG --rtype ARG --rport ARG

Adds a reader to the configuration. Please see "chipcardd2 --help".



4. Starting The Daemon
======================

"chipcardd2 --help" lists all possible command line arguments.

However, in most cases the following does suffice:

#>chipcardd2 --pidfile PIDFILENAME
where PIDFILENAME is the name of the PID file (used to store the process id
of the server which can be used to send signals to it).


For debugging purposes the following is more usefull:

#>chipcardd2 --pidfile PIDFILENAME -f --logtype console --loglevel notice

For "loglevel" you can use "--loglevel info" to increase the verbosity even
more. 
The option "-f" makes the daemon stay in the foreground. In this case you can
stop it using CTRL-C.


Please note that the server doesn't start if there is no line in the
configuration file saying "enabled=1".



5. Server Environment Variables
===============================


LCDM_DRIVER_LOGLEVEL
--------------------
Loglevel to be used for drivers. 
Version before 1.9.16alpha used LC_DRIVER_LOGLEVEL" instead.


LCSV_SERVICE_LOGLEVEL
---------------------
Loglevel to be used for services. 
Version before 1.9.16alpha used "LC_SERVICE_LOGLEVEL" instead.


LC_CTAPI_LOGLEVEL
-----------------
Loglevel to be used by the fake CTAPI.


OPENSC_LOGLEVEL
-----------------
Loglevel to be used by the OpenSC reader driver.



6. Client Setup
===============

Clients for libchipcard2 use the configuration file 
    $PREFIX/etc/chipcard2-client/chipcardc2.conf

This file contains a description of the chipcard2 servers to connect to.



7. Using Libchipcard2 in your own Projects
==========================================

Please have a look at the file in tutorials/. They pretty much explain how
Libchipcard2 can be used.



8. Remote Drivers
=================

As of version 1.9.10 Libchipcard2 supports remote drivers. These drivers are
used on thin clients (as requested by GnuMed).

For this to work you need to enable remote drivers in the server configuration
file ($PREFIX/etc/chipcard2-server/chipcardd2.conf).

Also, you will have to add a "server" section in the server configuration file
which is not "local" (because otherwise the remote driver could not connect
to the server).

The next step is to create a configuration file on the thin client which is
used by the remote driver daemon 
     $PREFIX/etc/chipcard2-server/chipcardrd.conf

An example file is provided. The driver sections in such a file are nearly the
same as in the server configuration file.



9. Using OpenSC with Libchipcard2
=================================

You can enable this driver with OpenSC by adding the name "chipcard2" to
the OpenSC configuration file variable "app/reader_drivers".
You will also have to add a driver section to that configuration file below
"app":

  ----------------------------------------X8
  reader_driver chipcard2 {
    module = /usr/lib/reader-libchipcard2;
  }
  ----------------------------------------X8
  
Such a section allows OpenSC to dynamically load the driver module.



10. Using Libchipcard2 With MacOS
=================================

The following commands will compile Libchipcard2 on MacOS:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./configure --prefix=/sw LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib CFLAGS=-I/sw/include CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include
make
sudo make install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration files are then expected in /sw/chipcard2-server.



11. Using the OpenSource Generic CCID Driver
============================================

Libchipcard2 1.9.12beta and later has improved support for this GPL licensed
driver. However, since Libchipcard2 uses this driver directly (i.e. without
using PC/SC) you will have to compile the driver yourself.
I suggest using version ccid-0.9.3 or better. To *compile* the driver you need
libpcsclite (but don't install the pcscd if you want to work with 
Libchipcard2). After compiling the driver you can safely uninstall
libpcsclite and still use the driver with libchipcard2.

------------------------------------------------------------- X8
./configure (all in one line)
  --disable-pcsclite 
  --enable-usbdropdir=/usr/lib/chipcard2-server/lowlevel/ifd
  --enable-ccidtwindir=/usr/lib/chipcard2-server/lowlevel/ifd
make
make install
------------------------------------------------------------- X8

This allows parallel installation of the non-PCSC version of the driver and
the PCSC version. Libchipcard2 always searches for the CCID driver in its
own lowlevel/ifd folder.

Please note that recent versions of this driver need libpcsclite installed
at build-time, but not at runtime. So please do this:
- install libcpsclite (and devel-packages, if any)
- build the driver as described above
- deinstall libpcsclite (because it might want to start the PC/SC daemon which
  unfortunately tries to completely take over control over all card readers it
  can lay its hands on)



12. Changes in Server Configuration File in 1.9.16alpha
=======================================================

For 1.9.16alpha the server engine has been completely rewritten. It is now
much easier to extend and it works much cleaner.

However, the new modular design of the server made it necessary to change the
structure of the configuration file a little.

The current version of Libchipcard2 should be able to read existing files,
but new files should be created according to the new format (see example
files in doc/). Existing files should be modified.

The changes are really minor:
- "Driver" sections are now below the new section "DeviceManager" instead of
  root
- "Service" sections have moved from toplevel to below "ServiceManager"
- "Reader" sections now use the variable "busType" instead of "com" to specify
  how the reader is connected


The new structure of the configuration file is this:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------X8

  Server {
    # server settings, haven't changed since previous versions, neither in
    # location nor in content
  }
  
  DeviceManager {
    # This is a new section, it contains the drivers which have been at the
    # topmost level of the configuration file in previous versions.
    
    Driver {
      # Driver section, the content itself is unchanged
      
      Reader {
        # The driver section contains a single change, which doesn't pose much
        # of a problem since a driver and reader section was mostly used with
        # serial devices.
        # The variable "com" (or sometimes "comType") was replaced by the
        # variable "busType" (this is due to the internal reorganization).
        # The following table shows how to convert existing settings:
        #
        #   Previously (com="")  I    New (busType="")
        #   ---------------------+--------------------
        #   com="serial"         I    busType="serial"
        #   com="usb"            I    busType="UsbRaw"
        #   com="usbserial"      I    busType="UsbTty"
        #       ---              I    busType="Pci"
        #       ---              I    busType="Pcmcia"
        #   -------------------------------------------
        # This allowed me to implement additional bus types (like PCMCIA).
        
      } # Reader
    } # Driver
  } # DeviceManager

  CardManager {
    # This is a new optional section which contains some card-related
    # settings (see example in doc/)
  } # CardManager
  
  ServiceManager {
    # This section now contains the "Service" sections which were found in the
    # topmost level in previous files.
    
    Service {
      # This is a service section as in previous versions. The only change is
      # that this section is now below "ServiceManager".
    } # Service
  }
  -------------------------------------------------------------------X8
