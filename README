Libchipcard is a library for generic access to chipcard readers and cards. It uses the
system-wide PC/SC service which is available at least on Linux, Windows and MacOSX.

On Linux you most will need the packages libpcsclite and a driver package. Most
readers on Linux nowadays use the generic CCID driver.

Please have a look at the file in tutorials/ to see how you can use Libchipcard in
your own projects.
