# Each server section tells a chipcard3 client where a chipcard3-server
# is sitting.
#
server {
  #
  # Connection type the server uses, currently supported are these:
  #
  # - "local"
  #   local server, using Unix Domain Sockets which can only be
  #   connected from the very same machine. In this case "addr" must point
  #   to the socket file used by the server.
  #   Some systems to not support these kinds of sockets (most notably
  #   Win32 systems).
  #   On all other systems this is the recommended type if no authentification
  #   is needed.
  # 
  # - "public"
  #   server using TCP sockets (not encrypted, for security reasons you should
  #   not use such a server with chipcard3)
  #
  # - "private"
  #   server using SSL secured sockets.
  #   New certificates are stored in the folder given by "newcertdir",
  #   received certificates are checked against those in "certdir"
  #   This is the recommended type if "local" is not available.
  #
  # - "secure"
  #   server using SSL secured sockets. In addition to mode
  #   "private" the certificate of the server is checked against
  #   those stored in the "certdir". If the server certificate could
  #   not be found or is invalid the connection is aborted.
  #
  typ="local"

  #
  # address the server is listening on (or socket file if type is "local")
  #
  addr="/var/run/chipcard3.comm"
  
  #
  # TCP port the server is listening on (not used if type is "local")
  #
  #port="55555"


  # if type is "private" or "secure" the following variables are used
  
  #
  # folder which contains valid SSL certificates (if the certificate of the
  # server is amongst those stored there then the connection is regarded as
  # secure).
  # Please note that this folder must be readable by every user who wants
  # to use libchipcard3-client programs.
  #
  #certdir="/etc/chipcard3/client/certs"
  
  #
  # this is the folder where newly received SSL certificates are stored.
  # By copying a file from this folder to the one given as "certdir" you
  # tell the SSL code that the certificates inside those files are to be
  # accepted
  #
  #newcertdir="/home/martin/.chipcard3/newcerts"
  
  #
  # if type is "secure" then the client needs to send a certificate to the
  # server in order to identify itself. This file should be in PEM format.
  # (see OpenSSL documentation)
  # When creating a certificate you should set the "commonName" field in the
  # certificate to the name used to identify yourself to the chipcard3 
  # server (most likely your username or real name)
  #
  #certfile="/etc/chipcard3/client/cert.pem"
