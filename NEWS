===========================================================================

This version includes several new features that have been back-ported
from the (soon to become) libchipcard4 branch. In particular, newly
supported readers are CardMedic 2, SCR 331, SCM 3320, Omnikey Cardman
4040, and also for the card type eGK. For the Celetronic CardStar2 the
second slot of this readers is supported now as well. Some build
problems have been fixed.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 3.0.2 (2006/12/27)
===========================================================================

This version fixes some bugs. The GeldKarte code is now able to read 
transactions from newer GeldKarte cards (->AqGeldKarte now works with those
cards as well).


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 3.0.1 (2006/12/25)
===========================================================================

This version fixes some bugs, adds autodetection support for the 
Cherry ST1044u reader and makes Libchipcard3 search for 64 bit drivers.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 3.0.0 (2006/11/02)
===========================================================================

This release adds the flag "keeprunning" to the SCM SPR532 reader (its
proprietary driver doesn't like to shutdown and reload). This version should
now work with any German medical card.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.4beta (2006/10/09)
===========================================================================

This release adds support for using the generic CCID driver with multiple 
readers in parallel and also adds support for the SCM 3310. This version 
supports external development of genuine Libchipcard3 drivers.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.3beta (2006/10/02)
===========================================================================

The slave manager has been completed, some errors have been fixed and this
version now compiles and runs under Windows. Support for Mandriva has been
added and clients can now receive notifications when readers are plugged in
or out. Init scripts have been added.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.2beta (2006/09/26)
===========================================================================

After receiving feedback some bugs have been located and fixed (including
a serious memory leak). A new method of making the server scan for hardware
changes (triggered by POSIX signals) has been added.
The CryptToken plugin for AqBanking has been moved into a separate RPM
package.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.1beta1 (2006/09/25)
===========================================================================

This is the first beta release of Libchipcard3.
The chipcard command and data structure handling has been moved from the
server to the client so the server can now concentrate on ressource 
management.
The remote driver code has been removed. Instead the server now has three
operation modes: stand-alone, master and slave. Devices on thin clients
can now be added and removed to/from a central master server. This makes it
very much easier to setup libchipcard3 on thin clients.
In standalone mode the server behaves just like former versions with the
same IPC connection modes.
The chipcard3-tool now has an additional command: "monitor". This command
makes the tool listen for changes on the server (such as drivers, readers
and cards started/stopped etc).
All IFD-alike drivers of Libchipcard2 have been merged into a single one
which now handles all those drivers (IFD2, IFD3 and CCID - both pre and post
1.1.0).
Some important bugs have been fixed and the card command description files
have been cleaned up.
"chipcardd3 init" now works as expected (the corresponding code in 
Libchipcard2 didn't work after some changes in Gwenhywfar some time ago).
The client API has been abstracted more to prepare a Windows port of 
Libchipcard3 (not yet finished).

                 Libchipcard2 2.1.8 (2006/08/25)

===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.7 (2006/06/15)
===========================================================================

This version allows readers without a keyboard to verify the pin of a
chipcard again. It also fixes a problem with newer GeldKarte cards and now
uses LibSysFS primarily to detect /dev/ttyUSB devices.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.6 (2006/06/16)
===========================================================================

===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.5 (2006/06/15)
===========================================================================

This version no longer requires the kernel sources to provide support for
PCMCIA autoconfiguration. It also no longer needs a specially compiled
version of libccid to work with that driver, the normal binary packages
suffice.

                 Libchipcard2 2.1.4 (2006/05/03)
