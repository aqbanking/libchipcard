===========================================================================

This is the first release of the new generation which works nicely on
Windows platforms as well. It is now also able to adapt to the different
reader types when using Windows' SCard service (for now only Reiner SCT
readers have been tested on win32 so far).
This version now also supports German medical cards with some more readers
by trying multiple protocols before giving up. This now allows to read those
cards e.g. with the Kobil Kaan Advanced.

===========================================================================

This release adds support for the latest Cyberjack device. All refrences to
Libchipcard3 have been renamed to simply Libchipcard (without a number). This

found on SuSE systems. The driver description file for O2Micro has been fixed.
WARNING: This version uses different paths for configuation files!!
As of 3.9.0 Libchipcard no longer bears the major version number in its name
or configuration files and paths.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 3.1.0beta (2007/04/03)
===========================================================================

This release adapts to the latest changes in Gwenhywfar. It now needs
Gwenhywfar3. Some bugs have been fixed and two additional readers are now
supported.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 3.0.2 (2006/12/27)
===========================================================================

This version fixes some bugs. The GeldKarte code is now able to read 
transactions from newer GeldKarte cards (->AqGeldKarte now works with those
cards as well).


===========================================================================

===========================================================================

This version fixes some bugs, adds autodetection support for the 
Cherry ST1044u reader and makes Libchipcard3 search for 64 bit drivers.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 3.0.0 (2006/11/02)
===========================================================================

This release adds the flag "keeprunning" to the SCM SPR532 reader (its
proprietary driver doesn't like to shutdown and reload). This version should
now work with any German medical card.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.4beta (2006/10/09)
===========================================================================

This release adds support for using the generic CCID driver with multiple 
readers in parallel and also adds support for the SCM 3310. This version 
supports external development of genuine Libchipcard3 drivers.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.3beta (2006/10/02)
===========================================================================

The slave manager has been completed, some errors have been fixed and this
version now compiles and runs under Windows. Support for Mandriva has been
added and clients can now receive notifications when readers are plugged in
or out. Init scripts have been added.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.2beta (2006/09/26)
===========================================================================

After receiving feedback some bugs have been located and fixed (including
a serious memory leak). A new method of making the server scan for hardware
changes (triggered by POSIX signals) has been added.
The CryptToken plugin for AqBanking has been moved into a separate RPM
package.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard3 2.9.1beta1 (2006/09/25)
===========================================================================

This is the first beta release of Libchipcard3.
The chipcard command and data structure handling has been moved from the
server to the client so the server can now concentrate on ressource 
management.
The remote driver code has been removed. Instead the server now has three
operation modes: stand-alone, master and slave. Devices on thin clients
can now be added and removed to/from a central master server. This makes it
very much easier to setup libchipcard3 on thin clients.
In standalone mode the server behaves just like former versions with the
same IPC connection modes.
The chipcard3-tool now has an additional command: "monitor". This command
makes the tool listen for changes on the server (such as drivers, readers
and cards started/stopped etc).
All IFD-alike drivers of Libchipcard2 have been merged into a single one
which now handles all those drivers (IFD2, IFD3 and CCID - both pre and post
1.1.0).
Some important bugs have been fixed and the card command description files
have been cleaned up.
"chipcardd3 init" now works as expected (the corresponding code in 
Libchipcard2 didn't work after some changes in Gwenhywfar some time ago).
The client API has been abstracted more to prepare a Windows port of 
Libchipcard3 (not yet finished).


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.8 (2006/08/25)
===========================================================================

This release fixes a bug which prevented Libchipcard2 from autodetecting
PCMCIA devices. This version now works with OpenSC 0.11.x as well.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.7 (2006/06/15)
===========================================================================

This version allows readers without a keyboard to verify the pin of a
chipcard again. It also fixes a problem with newer GeldKarte cards and now
uses LibSysFS primarily to detect /dev/ttyUSB devices.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.6 (2006/06/16)
===========================================================================

This version fixes a bug in the build system of 2.1.5 which prevented some
users from compiling Libchipcard2.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.5 (2006/06/15)
===========================================================================

This version no longer requires the kernel sources to provide support for
PCMCIA autoconfiguration. It also no longer needs a specially compiled
version of libccid to work with that driver, the normal binary packages
suffice.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.4 (2006/05/03)
===========================================================================

This release fixes some bugs with the CryptTokenDDV and libsysfs 2.0.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.3 (2006/03/26)

command "chipcardd2 addreader --dtype list" now works again.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.2 (2006/03/20)
===========================================================================

This release now works with Libsysfs 2.x.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.1 (2006/03/07)
===========================================================================

This release adapts the driver definition files for the Cyberjack to the
latest driver release (2.0.10) and removes some debug messages.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.1.0 (2006/02/27)
===========================================================================

This release fixes a problem with Debian's libtool and cleans up the API.


===========================================================================
                 Libchipcard2 2.0.0 (2006/02/14)
