The branches/gwen2_aq_3 branch was copied from branches/aq_3, r343,
which was the last aq_3 revision that still used gwenhywfar2.

Subsequent revisions of aq_3 that have been merged:

r349 added SCR 331 to ccid_ifd.xml (it reportedly works with this driver)
r350 disabled Linux-specific parts of DriverCTAPI_KeyCallback1() when KDMKTONE is not defined
r351 disabled Linux-specific include on non-Linux systems
r352 added function LC_Card_ReadBinary(); added new card type: eGK
r353 minor changes
r354 implemented card command "IsoModifyPin_Ascii"
r355 adjusted COPYING to cover Libchipcard3
r356 partially: fixed reader description for O2Micro; fixed compile bug in src/lib/sharedstuff; (but without configure.ac changes)
r359 Beautify configure.ac for Windows
r360 Remove auto-generated file
r361 Add GWENHYWFAR_CB to callbacks where they have been missing
r362 Replace CHIPCARD_CB by GWENHYWFAR_CB for callbacks that are used from gwen
